# Discord Bot

It seems most bots are programmed in python and javascript for discord, but since I am trying to practice java I decided to do this for my firends discord server. It's a pretty basic bot that responds to commands that then will send messages with inside jokes, etc. 

# WARNING:
Part of this bot is alerting people to swear words. The class 'Swearing' has a list of inappropiate words and slurs that shouldn't be said anywhere; for the purpose of preventing swears.
